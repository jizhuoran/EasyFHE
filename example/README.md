# EasyFHE Examples

EasyFHE provides several example projects to help users quickly learn and apply homomorphic encryption techniques. The current examples include:

- **Bootstrap Example**  
  *File:* `bootstrap/README.md`  
  *Description:* Demonstrates bootstrapping using a simple addition circuit.

- **ResNet Example**  
  *File:* `resnet/README.md`  
  *Description:* Showcases the application of homomorphic encryption on a ResNet-20 model using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

We are continuously working to expand our repository of examples. Contributions from the broader community are welcome and greatly appreciated.
